# Streaming from USB-enabled DSLR cameras on Debian distros  üì∏

Helper scripts for installing and running **USB-enabled DSLR** cameras on Debian
distros.

#### Manual steps after (if you choose not to use the helper scripts)

1. install dependencies
```
sudo apt install -y gphoto2
sudo apt install -y v4l2loopback-utils
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

2. plug the cameras' USB cable and unmount/eject the camera
(its initially mounted as a drive)

3. enable and determine the virtual video device (ignore errors)
```
sudo rmmod v4l2loopback
```

4. list all current video feeds (this will make it simpler to know which feed corresponds to the DSLR after we add it)
```
ls /dev/video*
```

5. activate `v3l2loopbacka`  (driver responsible for  enabling DSLR feed)
```
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 max_buffers=2
```


6. list all video feed devices once more identify new DSLR feed
```
ls /dev/video*

```

7. detect DSLR feeds' camera make
```
gphoto2 --auto-detect
```

8. get video feed and pipe it out for use as a virtual device
```
gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0 -f v4l2 <DSLR-feed>
```
for example:
```
gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0 -f v4l2 /dev/video2
```

#### Using the created virtual device

Simply, open app (e.g. OBS studio), and look for the virtually enabled device.
